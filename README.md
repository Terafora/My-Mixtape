<h2 align="center">About</h2>

My Mixtape is a website where you can creates a your own mixtape using various links to songs you enjoy from across the web so that you have all your favourite songs and music video in one centralised location which you can share with your friends. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for font-end operations, and Django for the backend. As a personal challenge I've also made sure to create all the art assets used by the sites myself using a combination of Figma, and LottieLabs. The site featurea an account system when users can log into a private account so that they can keep their mixtapes private and uneditable friom other users.

<h3>Figma Design Boards</h3>

The design for My Mixtape ended up being something inspired heavily by 80's synthwave aesthetics, however it was not always envisioned to be this way.
On my first designs and vision for this site the original idea for the presentation was actually a lot more inspired by early 2010's "Hipster" culture.  In particular my inspiration was the HUD elements which were present in Life Is Strange which was released in the same time frame.

Examples:

- [Life Is Strange HUD Example Images 1](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/g2QBYK)
- [Life Is Strange HUD Example Images 2](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=672)

When I began to make this however I saw that there was a limited appeal to this design as we aren't far away enough from the early 2010's for this to be nostalgic, while also not close enough to this time period for there to be a broad appeal. It's at this point that I decided to change gears and change up the design with what you see in the live product. The asymetrical, curvy designs were instead made into sleak straight neon lit lines. Unlike the culture of the early 2010's nostalgia for the 80's has been a hot commodity for a seeimgly long time now and with the idea of the site revolving around mixtapes the synthesis of the two was a no brainer, and so you have what you see today.

There was more designed than what made it to what is currently the final product and you may be curious about what those other assets may be so I'm providing a link to my Figma design boards below to that you can take a look yourself at what could have been, how my site was envisioned, and some hints at what may be coming in the future.
(Please note this does not contain information or assets about the site prior to changing the theming an 80's synthwave aesthetic)

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

My Mixtape allows users to:

- Create, Read, Edit and Delete mixtapes.
- Create, Read, Edit and Delete Tracks on mixtapes.
- Share mixtapes with friends via links to specific tapes.
- Consolidate all the links to users' favourite songs in one stylish package.

### Homepage 🏠

The homepage gives users a little glimpse at the site and gives the general idea of what My Mixtape is all about.

### About ❓

The about page goes a little in depth with what My Mixtape is all about, the problem it is solving and a little information about the creator of the website.

### Library 📖

The library page is where the magic begins to happen. From here users can create their own mixtapes and what mixtapes they've already created and have stored.

### Mixtapes 🖭

Inside each created mixtape is the view for users to create edit and delete tracks for their mixtapes as well as update the associated information for the mixtape.
In here users are able to go through the tracks they have added and enjoy what they have collected on their personalised mixtape as well as add, delete and edit the tracks on the associated mixtape.
At the top of the page is a share mixtape button which saves the url to the mixtape to the user's clipboard so they can share their mixes with friends and at the bottom of the page is an edit mixtape info button.

### Login/Logout/Signup 🔒

Nothing could be personalised though without the use of accounts and My Mixtape brings the ability for users to sign up with the website so that they can get to work making mixtapes.
They're also able to login and logout from the site so not only can they gain access to their mixtapes wherever they are but they can also keep their accounts secure with logging out.
A further benefit to this functionality is that it means users can create, edit and delete their own mixtapes and tracks, but are not able to do the same to other user's objects.

### Unimplemented Features

#### Animations

Animations were planned for this website to bring it even more to life, however in the interest of meeting deadlines and prioritising what would have the most impact the decision was made to leave the inclusion of animation out of the scope of this project for the time being.
An example of what was planned is below:
