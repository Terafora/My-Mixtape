# My-Mixtape

## About

My Mixtape is a website where you can creates a your own mixtape using various links to songs you enjoy from across the web so that you have all your favourite songs and music video in one centralised location which you can share with your friends. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for font-end operations, and Django for the backend. As a personal challenge I've also made sure to create all the art assets used by the sites myself using a combination of Figma, and LottieLabs. The site featurea an account system when users can log into a private account so that they can keep their mixtapes private and uneditable friom other users.

### About

The about page goes a little in depth with what My Mixtape is all about, the problem it is solving and a little information about the creator of the website.

### Library

The library page is where the magic begins to happen. From here users can create their own mixtapes.

### Mixtapes

Inside each created mixtape is the view for users to create edit and delete tracks for their mixtapes.
In here users are able to go through the tracks they have added and enjoy what they have collected on their personalised mixtape.
